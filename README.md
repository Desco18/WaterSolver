# WaterSolver
A simple Water Board solver. Solves all 40 Water Board layouts in a single water flow, considerably faster than other solvers.

# Usage
Download the mod from the [releases](https://github.com/Desco18/WaterSolver/releaes) page or build it yourself.
Grab the .jar and put it in your .minecraft/mods folder, as you would with any other mod.
It, sadly, requires Essential.
